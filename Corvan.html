    <p>"Rest assured that the gods are not asteemed anymore, my lord,
        now I can see you and I've seen it before. Shed no grace on me." -Corvan</p>
        <br>
    <h3>Backstory</h3> 
    <p>Corvan was an emperial soldier in <a class="text-link" href="Vertigonia.html">Vertigonia</a>
        during the <a class="text-link" href="The Dark Age.html">The Dark Age</a>. He was given
        the muatgens and training to become a witcher,
         but he ultimately set his sights on higher goals.
        Corvan was taken notice of by a particular few
        lesser deities at the very beginning of his life,
        including <a class="text-link" href="Yelvatana.html">Yelvatana</a> and <a class="text-link" href="Yelvata.html">Yelvata</a>, the goddess
        and god of death. In addition to these he was
        granted a trial by the <a class="text-link" href="Lady of the Lake.html">Lady of the Lake</a>, and she
        gifted him with the legendary sword <a class="text-link" href="Arodonite.html">Arodonite</a>.
        Using this sword, and also the legendary hammer
        <a class="text-link" href="Mjolnir.html">Mjolnir</a>, he fought a battle against a great dragon
        in <a class="text-link" href="Daleth.html">Daleth</a>.
        In the end Corvan sacrificed himself to kill
        the dragon, but found himself in the afterlife
        with much more power then he had first anticipated.
        Using these newfound strengths he led the mortal
        armies to rise up and take <a class="text-link" href="Godhome.html">Godhome</a>. And later the 
        spirit armies of <a class="text-link" href="The Hall of Souls.html">The Hall of Souls</a> to cast down <a class="text-link" href="Azathoth.html">Azathoth</a>,
        freeing the unrealities of half the universe. </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Corvan was angered by the tyranny of the gods
        and so he sparked the <a class="text-link" href="The Radiant War.html">The Radiant War</a>. This crusade lasted for over
        a thousand years as he crushed pantheon after pantheon, casting
        the souls of those slain gods down into other worlds.
        His companion <a class="text-link" href="Elwin Althorn.html">Elwin Althorn</a> and also his servant <a class="text-link" href="Thea.html">Thea</a> assisted
        him in most every seige and battle he took part in, these
        two had perished by the end of The Ruinations while Corvan 
        seemed to live on. See the <a class="text-link" href="Siege of Cinder.html">Siege of Cinder</a> for the first 
        true death of Corvan. Later he was killed by a queen of the <a class="text-link" href="Phyrexians.html">Phyrexians</a>,
        a second true death.</p>
