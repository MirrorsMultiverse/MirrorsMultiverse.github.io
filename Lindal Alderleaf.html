    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Lindal Alderleaf was a member of the Thieves' Guild clan <a class="text-link" href="The Black Hand.html">The Black Hand</a>,
        the son of its leader <a class="text-link" href="Landil Shadefell.html">Landil Shadefell</a>. After being expelled from the clan 
        at his father's death, he worked his way up in the world, became an avatar
        of <a class="text-link" href="The Watcher.html">The Watcher</a>, and then reclaimed control of the Thieves' Guild from his
        half-sister, <a class="text-link" href="Lundil Shadefell.html">Lundil Shadefell</a>. He eventually became a powerful king of
        the criminal underworld, taking his father's crown. He is a multiversal
        agent of chaos, a nuisance to the just, and a plague upon the righteous.</p>
    <h3>The Halving</h3>
    <p>At one point in his life, while in his father's mausoleum, at his father's grave,
        Lindal found a shimmering piece of cloth, which would come to be known as
        <a class="text-link" href="The Cloak of Landil.html">The Cloak of Landil</a>. When he touched it, his soul was split and infinitely. 
        When he touched it, his soul was split and infinitely
        duplicated by its wild magic, in a multiversal event known as The Halving 
        of the Halfling. As a result, an incarnation of Lindal (and thusly The Watcher)
        exists in every timeline and nearly every universe. Lindal is always either
        the number one most wanted by the <a class="text-link" href="Gatewatch.html">Gatewatch</a> or on the side of the Gatewatch.
        He was one of the most powerful humanoids in existence, but he ultimately
        fell to the wayside under the reign of <a class="text-link" href="Corvan.html">Corvan</a>. Corvan has attempted to kill
        Lindal on multiple instances and succeeded almost every time, but with
        endless incarnations the Halfling Watcher is practically immortal.
        Lindal's threr most prominent incarnations dwell in <a class="text-link" href="Vertigonia.html">Vertigonia</a>,
        <a class="text-link" href="Vetras.html">Vetras</a>,<a class="text-link" href="Castfar.html">Castfar</a>.</p>
    <h3>Lindal of Vertigonia</h3>
    <p>The original Lindal. Born to his human father and his Halfling mother
        Saorcia Alderleaf, he was raised in the ways of the Thieves' Guild.
        At his father's mysterious passing, he was usurped by his half-sister
        Lundil Shadefell, and fled the clan, fearing for his life. Alone and
        on the road, he met the Human <a class="text-link" href="Primrose the Dancer.html">Primrose the Dancer</a> and the
        Elf <a class="text-link" href="Elerrina Starborne.html">Elerrina Starborne</a>, who journeyed with him for a time.
        They received a quest while in the fledgling city of <a class="text-link" href="Daleth.html">Daleth</a>,
        and there fought a dragon. Later, while the party was trying to save
        the child <a class="text-link" href="Elva.html">Elva</a>, Lindal was marked by <a class="text-link" href="Yelvatana.html">Yelvatana</a> to become an avatar
        of <a class="text-link" href="The Watcher.html">The Watcher</a>, along with Elva. The group followed Elva as her
        Watcher powers grew, and Lindal witnessed the Battle between
        Elerrina, her patron deity <a class="text-link" href="Narria.html">Narria</a>, and Elva, which resulted in
        the Watcher fleeing. Shortly thereafter Lindal and his companions
        were captured by Lundil and <a class="text-link" href="The Black Hand.html">The Black Hand</a>. After seeing both of
        his companions killed, he was forced to fight Lundil in gladiatorial
        combat, and twice he saved himself from death by sheer force of will. 
        Eventually he was presumed dead, and taken to the mausoleum of his father. 
        There he found <a class="text-link" href="The Cloak of Landil.html">The Cloak of Landil</a>, and not knowing of The Halving that had
         taken place, he used it to sneak around the clan's city, recovering from
        his fight making allies in the Black Hand. Eventually his Watcher powers
        developed to fruition, and he challenged his half-sister for the
        leadership of the clan. He defeated her, and proceeded to use his powers
        to expand the black hand, eventually going to the empire of <a class="text-link" href="Fasadonia.html">Fasadonia</a>,
        to its capital city of <a class="text-link" href="Fasar.html">Fasar</a>, and killing the evil king Fasadus and
        Elva. He then conquered vast expanses of <a class="text-link" href="Kanta (Vertigonia).html">Kanta (Vertigonia)</a> in his
        new empire <a class="text-link" href="Lindonia.html">Lindonia</a>. His conquests were only halted by his former 
        companions Elerrina and Primrose, who had been sent by the gods from
        the afterlife to raise an army of Dragons to stop the Watcher.
        The massive battle that ensued, <a class="text-link" href="The Battle of Lindonia.html">The Battle of Lindonia</a>, would have
        gone on endlessly but for Lindal's choice to use his Watcher 
        powers to turn all living things in the surrounding area, 
        including himself, into stone. Thus ended the Vertigonian Lindal,
        unless some brave advenurer were to explore that haunted city of
        stone...</p>
    <h3>Lindal of Castfar</h3>
    <p>One variant of Lindal appeared in <a class="text-link" href="Castfar.html">Castfar</a>,
         in the city of <a class="text-link" href="Cosmeria.html">Cosmeria</a>.
        He was quickly recruited by the Gatewatch of that realm, but lived
        a mostly peaceful life, running a fish shop and occasionally checking
        in with the Gatewatch. This existence continued for 20 years, until
        by chance or fate he met <a class="text-link" href="Arimathea Oxicat.html">Arimathea Oxicat</a> and company, and joined a quest...<br>

        This version of Lindal has a flying octopus named <a class="text-link" href="Octavius.html">Octavius</a>.</p>
    <h3>Lindal of Vetras</h3>
    <p>Yet another variant of Lindal appeared in the <a class="text-link" href="City of Cinder.html">City of Cinder</a> in <a class="text-link" href="Vetras.html">Vetras</a>.
        This Lindal also joined the Gatewatch, and befriended the stable boy
        <a class="text-link" href="Capricorn.html">Capricorn</a>. This Lindal was responsible for wounding Corvan during
        the <a class="text-link" href="Siege of Cinder.html">Siege of Cinder</a>, although he himself was killed in the process.
        His memory lives on in a friend who never forgot him, The Time Knight.</p>
