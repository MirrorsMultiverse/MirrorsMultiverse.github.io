    <h3>Backstory</h3>
    <p>Ralof originally hailed from the Empire, living with his mother in the high rise palaces of Daleth. Ralof's father was a busy
       and powerful man, serving as a captain of the city watch during it's humble beginnings. However, with rising tensions in the 
       north from both Venevassa and The Blasted Lands, he thought it best to send his wife and son to safety in the free territories 
       of Kanta (Vertigonia). Ralof would make a vow to his father in their final days together, swearing to protect his mother no matter
       the cost. Upon their arrival in Kanta, Ralof would bring his mother into the colonized surface levels of the underdark, ruled by
       the princess Hedge. Nearly a decade would go by before his mother's unfortunate passing, leaving Ralof to fend for himself for
       the remainder of his younger years. Ralof wouldn't find his true calling until much later. Exhausted from his years of service
       in various Underdarkian taverns, Ralof pledged himself as a Paladin under his patron Narria. Bound under this new moral law,
       Ralof was rigid in his obligation to help all those in need like he did his mother before him. Try as he might to reunite with
       his remaining family after the events of the Call of Cthulhu campaign, Ralof would never see his Father again.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Ralof would soon join Holson Proudfoot and Ort after their arrival in the Vertegonian Underdark, seeking to assist it's king
       and rescue a group of Nobles kidnapped by the Mind Flayers. Ralof wielded his signature Flintlock Pistols throughout most of
       their journey across Kanta (Vertigonia). Although his Patron's calling would lead the party to the city of Senshara on the hunt
       for Cthulhu, Ralof would be forced to take on his alter ego of Tacitus Kilgore, an Emperial Ambassador seeking to infiltrate
       the city's political landscape.</p>
