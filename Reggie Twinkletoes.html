    <h3>Backstory</h3>
    <p>A half leprechaun brought up in the Abby of <a class="text-link" href="Ravenloft.html">Ravenloft</a>.
        He trained under Father _ as a monk until one day
        he was sent by the abby to seek out information about the Red Gate.
        He was changed when <a class="text-link" href="Elder Creel.html">Elder Creel</a> cast a particularly 
        powerful spell and grew an affinity to earth.
        He meets up with Elder Creel and <a class="text-link" href="Finbar.html">Finbar</a>
        on the beach and experiences the Red Gate opening.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Appears in the <a class="text-link" href="Ruination IV.html">Ruination IV</a>
         campaign with <a class="text-link" href="Elder Creel.html">Elder Creel</a>
          and <a class="text-link" href="Finbar.html">Finbar</a> and later when Finbar dies,
          <a class="text-link" href="Jasher.html">Jasher</a>.  He was guided throughout his journey by his morals,
            and also a fey spirit called <a class="text-link" href="Syl.html">Syl</a>.
             Reggie believed he was marked to cure the <a class="text-link" href="Bloodborne.html">Bloodborne</a>,
              and marked he was. Early on in his journey he killed an oni,
               setting himself directly against the dark god <a class="text-link" href="Orucus.html">Orucus</a>.
                He traveled through the land of <a class="text-link" href="Nineveh.html">Nineveh</a>
                 and then <a class="text-link" href="Camelot.html">Camelot</a> searching for a cure.
                  Eventually he learned that someone must be truly
            selfless and absorb all illness, in all the land,
            simply by committing self sacrifice. Elder Creel,
            learning of this, took Reggie's place.
            Reggie later met a brutal end when he was
            slain by an Obliterator of the 
            <a class="text-link" href="Phyrexians.html">Phyrexians</a>. The only witness to his death
            was one <a class="text-link" href="Hersine.html">Hersine</a>, who died immediately after the encounter.
            Reggie's likeness was later cast into a
            great statue of marble by <a class="text-link" href="Princess Rosa.html">Princess Rosa</a>,
            and over the decades a forest grew up around it.
            It was this forest that allowed for the fey to
            return to <a class="text-link" href="Vetras.html">Vetras</a>. The sacrifice and arcana of
            Reggie became a gate to the feywilds. The statue
            stands to this day, though covered in foliage,
            it is unbreakable, and it is guarded by earth
            elementals. Later when <a class="text-link" href="The Festering.html">The Festering</a> began,
             any man or woman who took a pilgrimage to
            the ancient statue and gazed upon it, would
            be healed. </p>
