    <h3>Backstory</h3>
    <p>A Djinn, stolen from his tribe as a child by human raiders,
        Tasharde was brought up as a warriors trained to be a
        gladiator. Where most children had toys, he had daggers.
        When most played with cats, he killed lions. Djinn
        are already a savage race, with the habit of mangling
        the bodies of their enemies after death, but Tasharde
        was merciless. Before meeting <a class="text-link" href="Olaf Stormcloak.html">Olaf Stormcloak</a> and
        <a class="text-link" href="Hadvar Stormcloak.html">Hadvar Stormcloak</a> he would frequently assassinate
        noblmen and their honor guards as revenge for his
        slain kin. Djinn dream of reclaiming the deserts
        of <a class="text-link" href="Lysand.html">Lysand</a> for themselves, as it has been once.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Tasharde guided Olaf and Hadvar through the deserts
        on a quest to find their brother. Rumors of one <a class="text-link" href="Saffron.html">Saffron</a>
        came, a queen of great might to take the deserts
        and perhaps, the world. Tasharde turned his efforts
        to finding and killing her. He was slain shortly
        after making this resolution by a sort of desert
        wraith. While his mortal body perished there,
        his spirit lived on and he became a Genie or a
        Djinn spirit of air and fire. As a Genie, Tasharde
        sought even more to prevent humans from gaining power
        in the world. And so, with his new ability to read the future
        , he sought out a weakling who would soon rise to power.
        The Genie challenged <a class="text-link" href="Corvan.html">Corvan</a> for <a class="text-link" href="Arodonite.html">Arodonite</a> when the
        <a class="text-link" href="Lady of the Lake.html">Lady of the Lake</a> first presented it to him. Corvan
        banished the Genie that was Tasharde's spirit back 
        to the <a class="text-link" href="Elemental Plain.html">Elemental Plain</a> after the Lady of the Lake
        applauded his courage and presented him with the sword
        regardless of his failure to originally defeat the Genie. </p>
